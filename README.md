# Silver Coin Calculator

A dynamic, client-side web application for calculating the total silver weight and melt value of a coin collection. The application is managed entirely through a simple CSV file, making it easy to add, update, and manage your coin list without touching the code.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Coin Loading**: The entire coin list is loaded from an external `coins.csv` file.
- **Real-time Calculations**: Total silver weight and melt value are calculated instantly as you input quantities.
- **Individual Subtotals**: See the melt value for each row of coins as you enter quantities.
- **Editable Spot Price**: Manually enter the current price of silver per troy ounce or per gram.
- **Collapsible UI**: Coins are grouped by country in clean, foldable sections for easy navigation.
- **Advanced Search**: A powerful search bar filters coins and countries in real-time, supporting multi-keyword searches (e.g., "UK Shilling").

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is self-contained. All files should be in the same directory.  
/silver-coin-calculator/  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # The main HTML structure  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css # All styling, including themes  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js # All application logic and functionality  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coins.csv # Your personal coin database

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Because modern browsers restrict local file access for security reasons, you cannot simply open `index.html` directly. The project must be served by a local web server. The easiest way to do this is with Python.

1.  **Download Files**: Place `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `coins.csv` in a single folder.

2.  **Populate Your Data**: Open `coins.csv` with a text editor or spreadsheet program and add your coin data. See the **Data Format** section below for details.

3.  **Start a Local Server**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the project folder where you saved the files.
    - If you have Python 3 installed, run the following command:
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```
    - This will start a local server, usually on port 8000.

4.  **Open the Application**:
    - Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
    - Go to the address: `http://localhost:8000`
    - The Silver Coin Calculator should now be running.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Update Spot Price**: If necessary, change the values in the "Silver Spot Price" section. The per-gram and per-ounce prices will stay in sync.
2.  **Find Your Coins**: Use the search bar to filter the list or click on a country name to expand its section.
3.  **Enter Quantities**: In the input box next to each coin, enter the quantity you own.
4.  **View Totals**: The **Totals** section at the top will update instantly, along with the individual subtotal for that coin row.
5.  **Change Theme**: Use the toggle switch in the header to switch between light and dark modes.
6.  **Clear Data**: Click the "Clear All Quantities" button to reset all inputs to zero.
