## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs to suggesting new features and writing code.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching the [Issues][issues-url] on GitHub.

When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:
- A clear description of the proposed enhancement.
- The "use case" or reason why this enhancement would be useful.
